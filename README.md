# SolidityGasSamples
This is to illustrate different ways to optimise gas - what to do and what not to do

# What it covers
1. Data Types
2. Contracts
3. Functions
4. Libraries and inter-contract execution
5. The optimiser

# How is it laid out
1. Deployment costs
2. Execution costs

# Variable naming

# Function naming

# Value initialisation vs. defaults

# UINTs

# Math

# Strings vs. bytes

# Arrays and Mappings

# Variable packing

# Structs

# Function Accessors

# Short circuiting conditionals

# Encoding and Hashing

# Inter Contract Execution (call/delegateCall)

# Libraries

# Inheritence and Overrides

# Cleaning up date to save gas

# Other storage concerns with Events

#

# Function Modifiers vs. Requires
